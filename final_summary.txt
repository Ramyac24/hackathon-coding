This report summarizes events captured by a security camera in an otherwise empty school hallway.

*   **00:08 - 00:38:** Two individuals exit a room on the left side of the hall and walk away from the camera. The first wears a red jacket and carries a bag; the second wears a light-colored shirt.
*   **00:39 - 00:51:** A third person in a grey hoodie walks from the far end of the hall toward the camera and passes out of frame.
*   **00:58 - 01:45:** A fourth individual, also wearing a grey hoodie, appears from the far end of the hall and stops at a glass door on the right. Using the reflection, they pull down their hood and remove a long, dark wig, revealing shorter hair. They place the wig in their backpack, adjust their own hair, and then turn and walk back in the direction they came from.
