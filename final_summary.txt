**Final Report: Security Footage Analysis**

This report summarizes security camera footage from a school hallway, recorded on the morning of March 1, 2012, beginning around 6:40 AM. The video captures a quiet, well-lit corridor as three individuals pass through.

*   First, a woman in a red hooded jacket carrying a shoulder bag emerges from a classroom and walks down the hallway away from the camera.
*   Next, a young woman with her hair in a bun, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and a backpack, walks from the far end of the hall towards the camera and exits the frame.
*   Finally, another young woman in a grey hooded sweatshirt stops at a set of glass-fronted display cases or doors. She uses her reflection to adjust her appearance, tying her hair into a bun and pulling her hood up before continuing on her way and leaving the camera's view.

The footage depicts typical, sparse activity in the school before the start of the academic day.
