*   **00:00 - 00:07**: The video begins with a static shot of a long, empty, and well-lit school hallway.
*   **00:08 - 00:25**: A woman wearing a red hooded jacket and carrying a shoulder bag emerges from a classroom on the left and walks down the hallway away from the camera until she is out of view.

*   **1:01 - 1:44**: Another young woman, also in a grey hooded sweatshirt, walks away from the camera and stops at a set of glass-fronted lockers or display cases on the right. She looks at her reflection, adjusts her hair, takes off her backpack briefly, and pulls her hood over her head before turning around and walking back toward the camera, exiting the frame.
*   **1:45 - 1:50**: The video ends with the hallway empty again.
