This security camera footage captures activity in an empty school hallway early in the morning. Here is a breakdown of the events:

*   **00:00 - 00:07:** The video begins with a static shot of a long, brightly lit, and empty school hallway. A timestamp in the upper left corner indicates the date is March 1, 2012, and the time is approximately 6:40 AM.
*   **00:08 - 00:26:** A person wearing a red hooded jacket and carrying a bag emerges from a door on the left and walks down the hallway, away from the camera, eventually disappearing at the far end.
*   **00:43 - 00:51:** A second individual, wearing a grey hoodie and a backpack, walks from the far end of the hall towards the camera and then exits the frame.
*   **00:58 - 01:45:** A third person, a young woman in a grey hoodie, walks from the far end of the hall. She stops at a set of glass doors on the right side of the hallway. She briefly puts her hood up, then takes off her backpack, and proceeds to fix her hair, tying it up into a bun while looking at her reflection in the door's window. After adjusting her hair and hood, she walks out of the camera's view.

The video shows a quiet morning at a school, with a few individuals arriving and moving through the corridors before the start of the day.
